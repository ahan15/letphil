# Introduction to Javascript

Javascript allows websites to have:
- form validation
- pop-ups and alerts
- image sliders
- interactive buttons
- dynamic content updates

Javascript works in web browsers without needing additional installations.

Javascript is used everywhere: modern web apps, mobile apps, and even backend systems (Node.js) rely on JS.

Key Takeaways:
- JavaScript makes web pages interactive
- Works with HTML and CSS to create dynamic content
- JS can be written inline or externally
- use `console.log` to debug and test code
