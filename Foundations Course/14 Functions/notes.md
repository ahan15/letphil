# Asynchronous Code and setTimeout()

- Understanding Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript
- setTimeout and setInterval for Delayed Execution
- Working with Promises (resolve, reject, then(), .catch())
- Using async/await for Cleaner Asynchronous Code
- Handling Errors with Try-Catch

What is Asynchronous Code?
- JS executes code line by line
- Sometimes certain lines of code need to wait for a response for it to run, and JS can execute other lines of code in the meantime.
- setTimeout() executes the code after a specified amount of time.

setInterval() executes code repeatedly after every specified amount of time.
clearInterval() "breaks out" of the interval code block.

.then() runs if the code receives a response
.catch() runs if there is an error
